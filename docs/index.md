Kubernate is a Kubernetes YAML generator that can be used as an alternative to other popular tools like Helm. Kubernate is distributed as a library and as a CLI, both working toghether to achieve one goal: Kubernetes as Code.

[The kubernate homepage](https://kubernate.dev) is a great place to get more information. Also checkout the [getting started guide](/getting-started) for a quick intro in how Kubernate works.

The official package is available on [NPM](https://npmjs.org/kubernate) but also on [GitHub packages](https://github.com/laurci/kubernate/packages/963222).
